# Whats up, Fe!n here. 

I build things with code—mostly focused on **AI experiments**, **game mechanics**, and **practical apps**. I like solving problems where technology meets creativity.  

### What I Do  
- **AI/ML Projects**: Building models for text generation, computer vision, and game AI  
- **Game Development**: Working with Unreal Engine 5 and C++ for interactive experiences  
- **App Development**: Creating cross-platform apps with React Native/Flutter + AI integrations  

### Current Focus  
- **Learning**:  
  • Leveling up my Python for AI and C++ for game engine work  
  • Exploring machine learning deployment for mobile  
  • Mastering Unreal Engine 5 blueprints and systems  
- **Building**:  
  • AI tools that work locally on devices  
  • Games with smarter NPC behavior  
  • Apps that blend utility with ML  

### Collaboration Interests  
Looking to team up on:  
- Mobile apps using AI/ML features  
- Game prototypes with unique mechanics  
- Tools that make development workflows smarter
